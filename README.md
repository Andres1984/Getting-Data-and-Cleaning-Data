# Getting-Data-and-Cleaning-Data
## Repo for the last assigment 

#Overview

This Course ended with the project for prove the abilities with the Data from  the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

I'm going to make the five points to explain the data, and make more easy to read, that is why we need to present the data like a tidy Data.

The points of the assigment will be:

* Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, crate a second, independent tudy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
All this information will be writte in a R code with the name run_analysis.R
